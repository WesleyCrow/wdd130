    <h2>Hey everyone! I'm Wesley Crow</h2>
  <p>I'm glad to be in this class with you all. Growing up in the Dallas, Texas area instilled a real love for wide-open spaces in me. There's nothing quite like escaping the city and hitting the trails with my wife! Hiking is a passion we share, and it's a great way to unwind and connect with nature.</p>
  <p>Speaking of family, I come from a lively bunch, parents, three younger siblings, and a dog who keeps us all on our toes. Now that I'm married myself, our family has grown to include two adorable cats. They may rule the house, but hey, cuddles are cuddles!</p>
  <h2>Outside of Family</h2>
  <p>Outside of spending time with loved ones, I'm a huge music buff. There's something incredibly energizing about a good playlist, no matter the genre. Learning about technology is another big interest of mine, it's constantly evolving, and I find it fascinating to see how it shapes our world. That's actually a big reason I'm majoring in professional studies with a minor in psychology and a cluster in sociology. This combination lets me explore the human side of the equation, how we interact with technology, and how it impacts our lives.</p>
  <h2>Dream Job</h2>
  <p>My dream is to become a therapist who uses technology to enhance the therapeutic experience. Telehealth and online therapy platforms are becoming increasingly popular, and I believe they can be incredibly powerful tools for making mental healthcare more accessible and convenient. Imagine using VR therapy to help people with phobias confront their fears in a safe, controlled environment. Or using AI-powered emotional recognition to provide early support and resources to those struggling with mild anxiety or depression. The possibilities are exciting, and I'm eager to see how technology can continue to shape the future of therapy.</p>
  <h2>Food & Entertainment</h2>
  <p>Food-wise, I'm a true Texan at heart. Give me a good plate of barbecue or some sizzling fajitas any day. But don't get me wrong, I love exploring new cuisines too. As for books and movies, I tend to gravitate towards sci-fi and fantasy. There's something so cool about exploring different worlds and pondering the "what ifs" of technology and society. But hey, I'm always open to suggestions, maybe you can introduce me to your next favorite read or film!</p>
  <p>Looking forward to getting to know you all better this semester!</p>
